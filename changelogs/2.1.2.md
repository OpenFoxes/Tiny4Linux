## What's Changed

This Patch updates **mainly the codebase and documentation**. For the **CLI-version** there is a **small bugfix** for the command `preset`. When given no specific preset number, a prompt is shown requesting to submit a number. That prompt contained the wrong literal:

### Updated Documentation

The documentation hasn't fully been updated for the new GUI (https://github.com/OpenFoxes/Tiny4Linux/releases/tag/v2.0.0) yet. Now, the screenshot at the top is switched out and a table shows a comparison of the GUI modes.
Also the developer documentation now contains instructions to run the CLI locally.

### Updated Codebase

A good project should have a clean, readable and maintainable codebase. Using `cargo fmt` the central `rust`-code was already formatted correctly.
For other file formats, such as markdown (documentation, `.md`) or YAML (configurations, `.yml`), there hasn't been a formatter yet. Now, prettier cleans those parts, that are not formatted by cargo.
