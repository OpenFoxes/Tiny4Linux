## What's Changed

This update focuses on the **Internationalization** (I18n) of the application. It is now available in the following **languages**:

- German
- English
- Spanish
- French
- Italian
- Turkish
- Ukranian

The app automatically **detects your systems language**. You can also use the new `lang`-flag on startup.

Known Bugs:

- #125 Some languages, like arabic and certain asian languages, get set by the automation, but have no supported font yet. I will address this issue shortly.
- #126 The deployed t4l command doesn't support the new `lang`-flag
