## What's Changed

This is a small release with a few, primarily technical, improvements.

### Logging

Most important of all is the update to the logging: only with activated debug (GUI) or verbose-flag (CLI), the raw data of the communication to and from the camera is tracked.

- #64: Adjusted debug logging by @Hirschfuchs in https://github.com/OpenFoxes/Tiny4Linux/pull/65

### CLI-Description

On use of the `help`-command, the general description of the `Cargo.toml` file was shown. It faultfully represented specifically the GUI-version. Now it shows the more general description "Controls for the OBSBot Tiny2 on Linux".

- 📝 Updated description to fit the CLI version by @Hirschfuchs in https://github.com/OpenFoxes/Tiny4Linux/pull/63

### Technical: Renovate & Codecoverage

In the background, there were some minor changes. The dependency update bot couln't read the entries for the asset-repo:

- 🔧 #50: Switched out faulty renovate config entries by @Hirschfuchs in https://github.com/OpenFoxes/Tiny4Linux/pull/56

Furthermore there was an update to the tests. Now the test results are uploaded to Codecov to enable the project to track the code coverage in the future. Right now, there are no tests.
