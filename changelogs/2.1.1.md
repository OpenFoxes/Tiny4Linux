## What's Changed

This is a small addition to version 2.1.0 (https://github.com/OpenFoxes/Tiny4Linux/releases/tag/v2.1.0).
It contains a bugfix regarding the version number. The command `t4l version` delivered the wrong version number, indicating that the tarballs that are packed on release contained the wrong version number. That issue was solved successfully in 60ed5e7.
Also, the version number has been added to the GUI in bfb7868.
