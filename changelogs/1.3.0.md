## What's Changed

This Release brings the feature of controlling the cameras speed while tracking. Like in OBSBOT Center you have two speeds to choose from — Standard and Sport. You can switch these as you like from within Tiny4Linux now.

- #21: Implemented Tracking Speed Control by @Hirschfuchs in https://github.com/OpenFoxes/Tiny4Linux/pull/23

Furthermore the rework of the UI has begun. In the first iteration, the goal is something close to the visual appeal of OBSBOT Center. In the future, multiple themes with user preferences is thinkable.

- First GUI rework by @Hirschfuchs in https://github.com/OpenFoxes/Tiny4Linux/pull/22
