## What's Changed

The feature I was missing the most, apart from the Sleep-/Wake-Toggle, was the **Preset-Control**. This release brings you the ability to **apply the presets configured in OBSBOT Center** directly from Tiny4Linux. (The configuration still has to be done in OBSBOT Center, see README)

- 🐛 Switch "Sleep"-Toggle on preset selection by @Hirschfuchs in https://github.com/OpenFoxes/Tiny4Linux/pull/31

Furthermore the manual **migration to iced**, the GUI framework, **version 0.13** was done:
